# Cassy - High Level Cassandra Client for Haskell


## Introduction

The intent is to develop a high quality, high level driver similar to
pycassa.

## API Documentation

Please see the Haddocks hosted on HackageDB:

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cassy


## Examples

### Database.Cassandra.Basic Usage

This module offers low-level functionality that is still much
more pleasant than using Thrift directly.

```haskell
import Database.Cassandra.Basic

test :: IO ()
test = do
  pool <- createCassandraPool defServers 3 300 "TestKeySpace"
  insert pool "testCF" "key1" QUORUM [col "col1" "value1"]
  getCol pool "testCF" "key1" "col1" QUORUM
```

### Database.Cassandra.Marshall Usage

This is the primary high level functionality module. Its use is
recommended above the other options.

- Columns can be any Haskell type with a CasType instance. See
  `Database.Cassandra.Pack` for what you can use there out of the box.
- You can choose how to encode/decode your column content. Out of the
  box, we support Show/Read, ToJSON/FromJSON, Serialize and SafeCopy.


Example usage: JSON-encoded columns

```haskell
import Database.Cassandra.Marshall
import Data.Aeson

type Name = String
type Age = Int
data Person = Person Name Age

-- Define JSON serialization for our data structure

instance ToJSON Person where
    toJSON (Person nm age) = toJSON (nm,age)

instance FromJSON Person where
    parseJSON v = do
        (nm, age) <- parseJSON v
        return $ Person nm age


test :: Person -> IO ()
test p@(Person nm age) = do
  pool <- createCassandraPool defServers 3 300 "TestKeySpace"

  -- I can use any string-like key and don't have to explicitly
  -- convert person to ByteString.
  runCas pool $ insertCol casJSON "testCF" "people" nm QUORUM p

  -- Automatically de-serialized back to a datatype
  res <- runCas pool $ getCol casJSON "testCF" "people" nm QUORUM
  case res of
      Just (Person nm age) -> return age
      Nothing -> error "Oh NO!!!"
```

## Release Notes


### Version 0.6

* Updated to work with monad-control instead of MonadCatchIO.
* Now using retry >= 0.3 for the same reason.
* More CasType instances in Pack module for completeness. Preference
  is shifting to using native Haskell types directly.
* `Database.Cassandra.JSON` module is now formally deprecated and will
  be removed in 0.7. Please switch to `Marshall`, which can replace it
  in entirety.

### Version 0.5

* Added `Database.Cassandra.Marshall` that is now intended to be the
  primary module to be used in all Cassandra operations. This module
  supercedes and replaces the `Database.Cassandra.JSON` high level
  module. Building on top of the Basic module, Marshall allows user to
  pick the serialization methodology for each of the operations. We
  provide out of box support for JSON, cereal, safecopy and plain old
  show/read.
* A new `TTimeStamp` type makes it easier to have timestamps as
  Long-encoded columns.
* There is now simple support for pagination of columns in wide rows,
  CPS-style. See the `paginate` function in
  `Database.Cassandra.Marshall`.
* Numerous other fixes and tweaks

### Version 0.4

This version packs a fairly large changeset. It will almost definitely
break your code, although the fix/adjustment is likely to be minor.

* Vastly enhanced the Database.Cassandra.Pack module to represent
  types that Cassandra can sort and validate.
* Added CasType typeclass that offers `encodeCas` and `decodeCas`
  methods that handle conversions to/from the binary ByteString
  representation.
* Composite columns are now supported through tuples. Just pick two or
  more CasType instances and put them in a tuple to automatically
  trigger composite column conversion. Keep in mind that your
  ColumnFamily schema must be configured right or else you'll get
  runtime exceptions.
* Added a bunch of newtype wrappers to directly map to types Cassandra
  knows. These include `TAscii`, `TBytes`, `TInt`, `TUtf8` and some
  others.
* Changed several methods in Basic and JSON modules to expect CasType
  column key values instead of concrete ByteString.
* Added the useful `packCol` and `unpackCol` functions to smoothly
  handle column key type conversions when working with the Basic
  module.
* Made the Cas monad a simple type synonym for ReaderT CPool.
* Added the `get_` metho to `JSON` to make it easier to discard key
  names and just get the column contents.
* Numerous fixes and minor tweaks.


### Version 0.3

* Added MonadCassandra typeclass, which is now used by *all*
  operations by default.
* Added a default Cas moand that instantiates MonadCassandra for
  convenience. 
* All Basic module ops now return results directly instead of an
  Either wrapper. Each operation may raise a CassandraException.
* Connection pooling now builds on top of the resource-pool library to
  initiate connections to multiple servers in round-robin fashion.
* Basic.insert now knows how to insert a SuperColumn.


## TODOs

* Add support for counters and batch mutators
* Add support for database/admin operations
